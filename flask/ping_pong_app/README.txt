This programme was created to expose a flask app in a virtual server in AWS (EC2).
The app allows to load results of ping-pong matches between different players, and it's capable, through Mysql DB, to mantain the results of all the games so that it's possible to query positions table for all players and more. 

The idea behind this project is to improve the application in order to get more funcionality. During this time, my idea is to get more analytics for the matches and players.

The app uses Flask as a web server framework, HTML, CSS, MySQL as a database system, and AWS EC2 as a server to host the app and expose it to public.
