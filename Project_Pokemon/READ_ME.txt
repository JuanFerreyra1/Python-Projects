This is a project which was created at the company where I work at. This code was developed by my two colleagues and me, and it's funny 
because with this file you can create a fight between three pokemon objects and output some things like the winner.
This programme takes an csv file with some pokemons and their features, clean this file and use it within another module to carry out
the action.
